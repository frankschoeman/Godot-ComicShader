# Godot-ComicShader
Work in Progress cell / comic shader for the Godot game engine version 4.3 
Looking for contributors.

To be implemented:
- Half-tone texture option for gradients
- Seperate textures/colors for light and dark with accurate colors.
- Code optimization since the groundwork is made in the visual editor
